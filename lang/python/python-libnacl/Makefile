define Package/python3-libnacl/description
This library is used to gain direct access to the functions exposed by Daniel J. Bernsteinâ€™s nacl library via libsodium. It has been constructed to maintain extensive documentation on how to use nacl as well as being completely portable. The file in libnacl/__init__.py can be pulled out and placed directly in any project to give a single file binding to all of nacl.
