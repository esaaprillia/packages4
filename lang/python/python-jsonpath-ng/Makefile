define Package/python3-jsonpath-ng/description
A final implementation of JSONPath for Python that aims to be standard
compliant, including arithmetic and binary comparison operators, as
defined in the original JSONPath proposal.

This packages merges both jsonpath-rw and jsonpath-rw-ext and provides
several AST API enhancements, such as the ability to update or removes
nodes in the tree.
